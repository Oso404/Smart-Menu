API Design and Architecture
Application Programming Interface
-allows us to build applications to talk to each other
e.g.
-an app can have users GET data, DELETE data, this idea 
is known as an Interface
-another app is allowed to talk to first app because first app has an API
e.g.
-frontend and backend programs can communicate via application
-overall 

Types of APIs
REST
- uses http and sends data in json format
- utilizes GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH each corresponding to a different action on a resource
SOAP
- alternative to REST
- not really used as much as REST
- instead of json uses XML messages
GraphQL
- interact with backend
- instead of exposing multiple endpoints it has one single endpoint
- there are two kinds of operations: queries and mutatios
- queries are for fetching/reading data whereas mutations are for modifying data
WebSocket
- bidirectional communication where frontend can talk to backend and vice versa
- connection is maintained 


RESTful APIs
-http methods
-endpoints
-http responses
-json data

REST API methods
GET - retrieve data from server
e.g.
youtube comments 
the backend stores the comments/data in db
we make a request to view the comments (GET)
the backend sends data in json format to frontend
now suppose we write a comment it and want to post it (POST) we utilize different http method

Endpoint 
= method + path (where path is URL)
GET /posts/{id}/comments (all post commments)
POST /posts/{id}/comments (add a comment)
